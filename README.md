# ecommerce-website
It's a third semester final project for the Web development class of my college.
The task was to create a personnalised ecommerce website with features like a custom database containing the required data (products, customer orders, etc), pages for products (showcases, shop all, etc) and a cart, which was saved inside of the user session.
I based the website around my pet conure named Kiwi, making it a shopping website for parrot products.
Made only for educational purposes.
